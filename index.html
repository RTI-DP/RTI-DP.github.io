            Diffusion policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic manipulation tasks. However, the iterative denoising process employed in diffusion policies results in long inference time, which limits the applicability to low-latency and simple tasks with a short cycle time.
            Recent methods have explored distillation and alternative policy structures to accelerate inference, but these approaches often require retraining the policy. This paper introduces a novel iteration scheme inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent iterations. We apply this scheme to diffusion inference and propose a scaling-based method to handle discrete actions effectively. The proposed scheme significantly reduces the computational costs without distillation or policy redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. Our quantitative results on numerous simulation experiments find a drastic reduction of inference time and an enhanced overall performance.
